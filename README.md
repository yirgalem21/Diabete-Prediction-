Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning.

This project leverages real-world health survey data from the CDC BRFSS 2015 to build, evaluate, and deploy robust machine learning models for predicting diabetes status. The goal is to provide accurate, actionable risk assessment for individuals based on their health indicators.

Features

Comprehensive ML pipeline: Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, supervised and unsupervised modeling.

Model comparison: Evaluation of multiple algorithms including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, MLP, and more.

Explainable predictions: Identification of top risk factors using feature importance analysis.

User-friendly interface: Deploys the best model as an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time diabetes risk prediction.

Reproducibility: Code and instructions provided for full pipeline retraining and app deployment.

Dataset

Source: CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015

Processed version: UCI ML Repository

Results

Best models: MLP, LightGBM, and XGBoost all achieve high accuracy and F1-score on test data.

Top predictors: BMI, Age, General Health, High Blood Pressure, and Physical Health.

Accessible screening: The deployed app allows anyone to estimate their diabetes risk using simple health indicators.

Why this matters

Early detection of diabetes risk empowers individuals and healthcare professionals to intervene sooner and more effectively. This project demonstrates how open data and modern machine learning can create scalable, user-friendly tools to improve public health.
